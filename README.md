## VProfile Deployment on AWS
The VProfile project is deployed on Amazon Web Services (AWS), utilizing various services to ensure scalability, security, and performance. Hereâ€™s an overview of the deployment architecture:

## Key Components

## Security Groups:

We created specific security groups for each service:
Load Balancer Security Group: Routes incoming traffic to the appropriate instances.
Application Security Group: Protects the instance running Tomcat and specifies allowed inbound traffic.

# Backend Services Security Groups:
Configures access for backend services by specifying their ports.

## Amazon S3:

Utilized for storing project data. Data can be retrieved in the application instance using the AWS CLI. This allows for both command-line and GUI access to the stored data.

## Route 53:

AWS's domain name system (DNS) service is used to map IP addresses to backend services. This enables easier management and better accessibility for users.

## Auto Scaling Group:

Configured to monitor our instances automatically. It scales the number of instances up or down based on load, ensuring that the application remains responsive and available during peak times.
